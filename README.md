# sortfiles-macos
A simple script, written in Python, for macOS. When you run this script, all files in the working directory are moved to a subdirectory called "sorted" and sorted there into further subfolders: "Music", "Videos", "Documents" (without PDFs), "PDFs", "Others".

You can set an alias for this script in the .zshrc config:<br>
``alias sf="python3 /path/to/script.py"``<br><br>
Now run the script in the console with the alias "sf".
